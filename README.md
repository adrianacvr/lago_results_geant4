## The "make_histograms" folder contains:
	-The .root files for each site. 
	-The script to convert the .root files to .dat files.
	-The script for switching from pe to deposited energy.
	-The script to plot the charge histograms of each site.

## The "total_energy_data" folder contains:
	-Total energy deposited data per component per site.
	-The comparison of the energy deposited by the muons with the other components in each site.
	-The particle flux detected by the WCD per site.

> Each folder contains a README file where it is explained how the data were extracted and plotted.
